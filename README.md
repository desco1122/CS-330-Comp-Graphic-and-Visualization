# Computer Graphic and Visualization Project Reflection

# *How do I approach designing software?*

When designing software, I prioritize understanding the problem domain and user needs. This project has refined my ability to break down complex problems into manageable components. I’ve also become more adept at sketching preliminary designs and iterating on them based on feedback and testing. Throughout this project, I honed my skills in creating more intuitive and user-centered interfaces. I’ve also improved my ability to anticipate potential issues in the design phase, leading to a smoother development process. I followed an iterative design process for this project, starting with a basic prototype and gradually refining it. I gathered feedback at each stage, which informed my design decisions and allowed me to address issues early on. I can apply the design tactics I employed here, such as iterative development, user feedback integration, and early prototyping, to future projects. These approaches ensure that the final product is both functional and well-designed. 

# *How do I approach developing programs?*

My development process is methodical, emphasizing incremental progress and regular testing. This project, in particular, has taught me the importance of maintaining a flexible codebase that can easily adapt to changes in design or requirements. In this project, I explored new strategies such as modular programming and utilizing external libraries for more efficient coding. These strategies not only improved my code's efficiency but also its maintainability. Iteration was crucial in this project. Each iteration allowed me to refine both the design and functionality, ensuring that the final product met all requirements. Continuous testing during these iterations helped catch any mistakes, making the development process more robust. My approach to developing code has become more structured and disciplined through this project. I’ve learned to better manage my time and resources, which has led to more consistent progress and a stronger final product.

# *How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?*

This project has reinforced my belief in the power of computer science to solve real-world problems. Computational graphics and visualizations, in particular, have provided me with new skills that I can apply in both my educational and professional future. These skills not only enhance my technical abilities but also open new avenues for creative problem-solving in various fields. Overall, this project has been a significant step in my journey, helping me to refine my design and development processes while also giving me new tools to achieve my future goals.
